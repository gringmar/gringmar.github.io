    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Developed using Unity, Mapbox, AR-Core and Android</h3>

        <p>
            Private Investigators is a project part of the course DH2413 Advanced Graphics and Interaction at KTH. The
            course has different themes each year and for our project it was "Socially-distant Interaction".
        </p>
        <p>
            Private Investigators is a concept for an asymmetric cooperative crime mystery game where players
            collaborate to solve a crime together as quickly as possible. Each player can play as one of several unique
            roles and together the players collect clues and use their deductive skills to make an accusation, revealing
            the guilty suspect and other details of the crime.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Development process</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Our design process began as multiple brainstorming sessions where we generated possible ideas for the
            project first through the application of the “yes, and” technique, and by later refining them by filtering
            the features of each idea we liked the most. Our proposal has since been developed also based on the
            synergies between modalities of interaction and different graphic techniques we came up with. To define more
            in detail the features as well as the game mechanics, our plan is to involve potential players in a process
            of participatory design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asymmetrical co-op fits our socially-distant criteria by enabling players to maintain the current
            restrictions as well as encouraging the players that can, to get exercise. For players that have physical
            limitations to leave the house there are other roles so they can also join the adventure. This makes the
            experience inclusive and accessible to players with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of the game was modular, in that the individual interaction modalities and advanced
            graphic techniques will be implemented as standalone features and only those that best suit the game concept
            were included in the final prototype. We applied Scrum as an agile method, alongside iterative
            prototyping to the development process.
        </p>

        <h3>Augmented Reality and Inputs</h3>
        <p>One of the main features associated to the Genius role is the presence of AR in the game. It enables original
            and entertaining interaction modalities, which keep even a home-based player involved in the progress of the
            investigation. The user can select a piece of evidence from the inventory, place it in the surrounding
            environment, scale it to the desired dimensions and inspect its surface with a virtual UV lamp in search for
            potential clues. Unlocking the clues hidden on the different items will help bring the investigation
            forward.</p>

    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <h3>Developed using D3.js and JQuery</h3>
        <p>
            Project Eir is a project part of the course DH2321 Information Visualization at KTH. For this project, we
            needed to get in contanct with companies and researchers and develop a visualization that suited their
            needs.
        </p>
        <p>The main goal of Project Eir is to allow researchers and medical personnel to <strong>explore </strong>
            trials and <strong>discover trends</strong> of clinical data</p>
        <p>
            For this project, we had three main stakeholders, researchers, civilians, and medical personnel.
            Due to the short amount of time, we decided to focus on
            researches exclusively.
            After a meeting with one of the stakeholders, a researcher working at Karolinska Institutet, we defined the
            main goal of the project is to
            provide a good overview of the data as well as detailed information about a specific clinical trial. Another
            important task was
            to find trends in the field of research.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Development process</strong></h2>
        <p>
            We brainstormed a lot about visual mapping. Our data scaled extremely fast from one dimension to the
            next. There are around twenty main categories and in the text level thousands of diseases, and every disease
            could have all the way from 1 to thousands of trails. In total does our database include over 2.5
            million nodes. The tool utilizes data from the clinicaltrial.gov api, being updated in real time. Due to the
            amount of incosistent data formating provided by the API, a big challenge was being able to categorize and
            filter data effectively.
        </p>
        <img src="img/infovis/brainstorm.PNG" alt="">
        <p>
            We had several meeting with our stakeholder and professors discussing and prototyping ideas. Deconstructing
            the data and utilizing the visualization pipeline to find the optimal visualization method for our case.
            To get a good overview we decided to use an icicle as our main categorization tool. Originally we thought of
            a Sankey diagram
            but due to some difficulties with getting it to work with our data, did we switch to the icicle, However, we
            are very
            satisfied with the results. The project was presented in several occasions to peers. Observations and think
            aloud were used as methods to study the efficiency and effectivness of the tool when completing certain
            tasks.


        </p>
        <h2><strong>The Result</strong></p>
        </h2>
        <p>The result is an Icicle that allows the user to select a specific category or disease. The tool provides
            filter options as well as a
            search bar to find specific diseases or categories. We included Breadcrumbs to help the guide the user
            through the hirerarchy of the data.

        <h2><strong>What I learned</strong></p>
        </h2>
        <p>
            This project was a great continuation to the visualization knowledge I had acquired through my education. It
            was very close to a real case scenario, since we had to work with a stakeholder outside of KTH and meet
            their demands. Working for a field from I have little knowledge about was very interesting and challenging. 
            This project also allowed me to develop further my Java skills using D3.js and its integration with Html and CSS.

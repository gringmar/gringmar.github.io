    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Developed using Unreal Engine 4</h3>

        <p>
            Primal Party is a local multiplayer party game that focuses on 2vs2 competition. Initially the project was
            part of a 10 week Game Design course at Uppsala University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primal Party developed by Team Hexagonal has been part of several events beyond the academic environment.
            Primal Party participated in the Gotland Game Conference 2018 (GGC) and at the game jam GameCamps
            2018 in Finland were the project was further developed and presented to investors.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Development process</strong></h2>
        <p>
            The first version of Primal Party was developed during a 10 week period. The team Hexagonal of 6 members
            consisted of 2 programmers, 3 artists and 1 project manager. The ambitious team worked full time for the
            entire development utilizing scrum.
        <p>
            Each week consisted of daily standups, playtesting sessions, design meetings and team building activities.
            The good synergy of the team and good progress of the project pushed us to aim for continuing the
            development of the game further, participating in several events.
        </p>


        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>My Contributions</strong></p>
        </h2>
        <h3>Development in Unreal Engine 4</h3>
        <p>Focused mainly on developing the AI, UI and animation implementation. Developed the Coin Rush game mode.</p>
        <h3>Game Design</h3>
        <p>A big pitfall in this project was the ambition and high expecations we decided to meet. Even if all of them
            were met during the development, the thing that we did not foresee was how all the things we planned and
            added would affect everything else in the experience. That is why I decided to utilize the core of our game
            to create a more simple gamemode, coin rush, which resulted to be very successful. Which combined the simple
            input but the goal and the amount of information provided to the player was reduced. We concluded that if we
            would continue the development we would start very small and building the small blocks that are the
            foundation of the project.</p>

        <h2><strong>What I learned</strong></h2>
        <p>
            During the 10 week project we got very in depth working with Unreal Enginge 4. The team was split up in
            defined roles par to the industry and the project was developed using Scrum. Due to the sucess of the team,
            we decided to further push the project and present it to investors at GameCamps. This was my first contact
            with the industry outside of my education and it was a great opportunity for personal growth.
            The biggest takeway from this project was the closest contact with the industry and indepth working with
            scrum.

    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Developed using Android Studio, Unity and Director Musices</h3>

        <p>
            TAILS is a multimodal Interactive Fiction concept, created to make interactive fiction more immersive. Using
            a story from Twine we implemented multiple modalities in Unity. We added text-to-speech from Android, music
            using Director Musices and vibrotactile feedback using Unity3D. To evaluate the concept a study with six
            expert participants was conducted where they were asked to compare the text based story with the TAILS
            application. Although most of the participants preferred the multimodal experience of the story over the
            unimodal version, the synthesized voice was perceived to be unpleasant and failing to describe the emotions
            of the content.

        </p>

        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Development process</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Taking into consideration the limited time and resources allotted to this project we set out to create a
            simple prototype that demonstrates the potential of the TAILS concept. To develop this prototype we chose a
            single Twine story, Invasion by Cat Manning*. This story was chosen after examining a multitude of different
            Twine projects, evaluating them on criteria such as duration, complexity, interactivity and content
            accessibility. The platform we decided to focus on is Android tablets, these tablets were chosen since we
            required haptic feedback, large readable text and text-to-speech support.
        <p>
            The default compiler for Twine exports stories into HTML. However, since HTML was suboptimal for our
            technical requirements we opted to use Cradle, an open-source Unity Twine compiler developed by Doron
            Assayas Terre. By using Cradle we were able to develop our prototype using Unity as our main development
            environment. In addition to Unity, we used the Azure Text Analytics API to extract sentiment analysis scores
            and KTH’s Director Musices was used to modify music according to the sentiment scores.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Evaluation</strong></h2>
        <p>To assess the potential of the TAILS concept the multimodal prototype was evaluated in comparison to an
            unmodified unimodal experience. The evaluation was performed using the combination of Think Aloud evaluation
            and
            a semi-structured interview. Six participants experienced both the unimodal and multimodal versions of the
            experience and shared their insights and comments on both. Each evaluation session took approximately one
            hour.</p>
        <p>
            Think Aloud is a method which prompts subjects to talk aloud while usually performing a task. It is
            considered a
            valuable method for understanding the user’s cognitive processes during the experience and forming a
            task-related cognitive process model. The choice to use Think Aloud evaluation was based on the
            suitability
            of this method for time constrained projects as well as the availability of interaction designers as test
            participants. By using Think Aloud we attempted to gain insight into the emotional effect of the
            additional
            modalities as well as the general perception of these modalities.</p>
        <p>
            The evaluation was conducted with a single user at a time in an isolated room in order to avoid distractions
            from external factors. The same story was used for each user, with users experiencing the same story twice.
            The
            ordering of the different versions of the story (unimodal or multimodal) was split equally between users to
            lessen ordering effects. Documentation of the evaluation was carried out by recording the interface while
            transcribing the user’s comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            After users experienced both the unimodal and multimodal version a short semi-structured interview was
            conducted. The purpose of this interview was to enable the users to reflect on the different experiences,
            engage
            in guided speculation of an ideal multimodal experience and emphasize what they found enjoyable in both
            versions
            and what they found was lacking.

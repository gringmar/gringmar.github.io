        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Prototyped using Figma</h3>

        <p>
            In recent times, with the worldwide spread of Covid-19 and
            the subsequent limitations posed on gatherings of people
            by many governments, online education has proved to be
            an invaluable resource for compensating the impossibility of
            students of any grade and age to attend traditional classes.
            More and more pupils have been increasingly forced by the
            circumstances to rely on their own abilities to manage their
            progress and improvements over time, through a practice
            referred to as Self-Regulated Learning (SRL). To aid them
            in this activity, providing a learning analytics tool with the
            ultimate goal of increasing the quality of their learning is to
            be considered of utmost importance. Previous research on
            SRL shows that supporting students in developing skills in
            this set of practices can improve learning outcomes by 20%
            and learning support and teaching by 22%. Therefore,
            providing SRL support to students will help them achieve
            greater online academic success. The most popular
            method of doing so is through multiple visualizations (combined in a single dashboard, for example), which
            ultimately
            raise students’ self-awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            We propose a high-fidelity prototype for a
            web-based, interactive visualization tool meant to support
            SRL in its strategies with a focus on time management
            and goal setting in particular. The target users of such an
            online platform are students partaking the Information Visualization course, held between the months of
            January
            and March at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The primary motivation behind the project, is to replace the
            timetracking system currently in use – consisting of a spreadsheet recording all individual students’
            activity over time,
            with a more interactive and informative interface designed
            with the principles of SRL in mind. To achieve this, we have
            addressed the following research questions:</p>


        <h3>
            1- What should the interface of the online tool look like?
        </h3>
        <h3>
            2- What features should be implemented?
        </h3>
        <h3>
            3- What is the impact of the tool on users’ daily learning
            management activities, focusing in particular on time
            tracking and goal setting?
        </h3>


        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Development process</strong></h2>
        <p>
            We started our work by collecting theory models by reviewing the literature and analysing the current
            available tools
            in the market. Next phase is performing a requirement elicitation by distributing an online survey and
            conducting two
            semi-structured interviews applying participatory design.
            Previous students of IVIS were involved. The quantitative
            survey was completed by ten students while two students
            took part in the qualitative survey. In order to gather the
            elicited requirements and speculate on how to address
            them, a brainstorming session took place to define the
            guidelines of the project while keeping the principles of SRL
            in mind.
        <p>
            Afterwhich, a lo-fi prototype was sketched in Miro along with
            the basics of an interaction flowchart. Based on the feedback from our supervisors, a hi-fi prototype was
            developed
            in Figma, along with interactions and improved widgets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final high fidelity prototype was developed in figma. It
            was based on our initial design using SRL theory, and was
            set to achieve the set of goals and features that we had set
            in previous design meetings. Since the prototype followed
            the basis of SRL principles, we emphasized each phase of
            SRL as a separate section, with its own set of functionalities according to its main purpose, this while
            keeping the
            cyclical synergy of the SRL Zimmermann model. The main
            goal of the prototype was to suggest a supportive tool for the student which, while being easy to use, would
            help the
            user to improve their self regulated learning. At the same
            time, such tool had to be versatile and adapt to different
            types of students. The prototype was divided into 4 section
            of one page each: Homepage, Planning, Performance and
            Reflection.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
        <p>The project provided a learning dashboard to support student’s SRL, specifically for students of the
            Information Visualization course offered at KTH. It is a simple and userfriendly tool designed for
            individual students in group works.
            The platform includes features that support planning, performance, and reflection in SRL, as well as a home
            page.
            The concept of our learning dashboard with rich visualiza-
            tion is well received by the students based on our survey,
            interview, early prototype as well as final prototype feedback. A Think Aloud Protocol was conducted to
            evaluate
            the platform and the four topics were extracted of which the
            problems and improvements were discussed in the results.
            It is also of utmost importance to mention that further research is required to address the fact that the
            tool has the
            potential to be expanded for other courses other than Information Visualization.</p>

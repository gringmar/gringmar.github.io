    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">

        <h2><strong>About the Project </strong></h2>
        <p>
            Haikul is a project part of the course DM2601 Media Technology and Interaction Design at KTH. For this
            project we needed to design a product or experience with the theme Media@HOME. The course aimed to have
            students design within a specific topic using the double diamond framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Haikul is a service designed for adult siblings to connect more when meeting, by using haikus. Haikus
            are a simple form of japanesse poetry where the poems are made up of three sentences, a five-syllables
            sentence followed by a seven-syllable sentence and finally another five-syllable sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The experience of writing and sharing a haiky is meant to encourage self-reflection and also help
            siblings share about their day to day. Talking about their triumphs, tribulations and sentiments in a
            way that is the same time personal and playfully vague.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Development process </strong></h2>
        <strong>
            <p>Discover</p>
        </strong>
        <p>
            After discussing we decided to establish the view of home as a place where family lives and interacts. After
            an intial user study we narrowed down our user group to adult siblings aged 20-40 who wish to have candid
            conversations when meeting. We felt a clear design challenge to help them have better interactions when
            meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We continued by conducting an in-depth study with a total of 10 participants, gathering stories of their
            sibling interactions and trying to determine with them what is missing from these interactions. We've found
            that the majority of our users wished to have more meaningful conversations with their siblings and catch
            up. In addition to that some of out user mentioned wishing to engage in play with their siblings, being more
            present and meeting in a way that is continuous and structured.
        </p>
        <p>
            After establishing the user group and our main goal, we started with our brainstorming sessions, using
            methods such as "Fast visualization" and "Yes and...". We drew inspiration form family photo albums,
            puzzles, RPGs, zen Buddhism, co-op games and novel technological platforms.
        </p>
        <p>We conducted secondary research with the intention of exploring the academic grounding of our concepts and
            drawing inspiration from novel research in the domain of sibling interactions.</p>

        <strong>
            <p>Define</p>
        </strong>
        <p>
            To get a better understanding of what real user would actually want and how our intended users would
            interact we synthesized several personas based on our user studies. The personas were then classified as
            main personas, secondary personas and negative personas.
        </p>
        <p>After synthesizing personas, we wrote down different scenatios where they meet and interacting with each
            other. These scenarios helped us identify desing challenges and opportunities. We sketched to visualize our
            ideas and share them within the group. The sketches helped us realize the strengths and limitations of these
            concepts as well as communicating them to peers for feedback. Haikul was then suggested as the most
            appropriated for team building exercises as well as catching up.</p>

                <p>Develop</p>
            </strong>
            <p>
                We developed a simple paper prototype and mocked up the AI component of the experience by having a team
                member play the Wizard of Oz and generate the final haikus according to user's input. This experience
                was
                then evaluated by potential users.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to use bodystorming to explore gow we could emphasize the concepts in Haikul. In this process
                we
                imagined that the Haikul main interaction is ready for consumer use and tried to enact a full experience
                using it. This resulted in the development of the mood-cloud prototype. An experience meant to encourage
                our
                users to revisit past Haikus and recall how they felt while writing and sharing them.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <p>Deliver</p>
            </strong>
            <p>To present our concept we mocked-up a simple app for haiku generation and created a video suggesting how
                Haikul might be used. In the video the two actors portray two of the personas we defined previously
                (seconcary and main). </p>

            <p>For this project I was very inspired by the traditional Japanese style, specially the traditional
                woodblock
                prints (木版画, mokuhanga) and iconic simbols from Japanese culture.</p>

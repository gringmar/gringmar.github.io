    <!--About The Project-->
    <section class="portfolio-item-individual" id="about">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Developed using Elm, Phoenix (Elixir), JS and CSS</h3>

        <p>
            A website that provides a real-time chat room for the lecture. Here the students can send
            anonymous questions and the professors can respond digitally or verbally. Answers from
            professors or fellow students can be crowd-sourced to automatically give answers to common
            questions. Some select questions would also be answerable through online queries.

        </p>

        <h2><strong>Problem Definition</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Traditionally lectures in universities have been practicing passive teaching methods. This form of teaching
            requires the lecturer to be able to convey the lecture without any unclarity or misunderstandings between
            them and the students. In reality this is incredibly difficult, and research shows that a more active
            approach to teaching produces
            better results. In order to achieve the improved results itâ€™s necessary for the lecturer to assess their
            audience and allow them to ask questions.

        <p>
            In active teaching today there is a large communication distance between lecturer and students and little
            interactivity between student and lecturer. This results in good questions going unasked, and there is no
            way of prioritizing which questions asked are the most important ones.

            In active teaching a lecturer also spends too much time answering simple questions that could be
            automatically answered. This is an orthogonal problem of the interactive lecture-problem, though combining
            the two solutions will synergize very well. The analysis of the two separate problem domains will be
            analysed individually.
        </p>

        <p>
            There have been several approaches to make tools to make teaching and lectures more active and the
            communicative distance between lecturer and student smaller, but none of these tools solve the problems we
            face in its entirety.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Evaluation</strong></h2>
        <p>
            To evaluate the website, case studies that combined structured interviews and observation of users while
            interacting with the website were conducted. Participants consisted of TAs, Professors and students from
            KAIST
            (Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology).</p>
        <p>
            Results show interest of using the website from all participants and percieved value. Obsertvations matched
            users perception of easy-to-use interface, due to the low time from users in performing tasks. Users
            opinions are ambiguous regarding the intrusiness of notifications, thus a flexible option to notifications
            was included.
        </p>
        <p>
            The architecture was benchmarked and showed promising results of low latency of 100 requests per second and
            41.7 ms latency in the worst case scenario.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about"><strong>My Contributions</strong></p>
        </h2>
        <h3>Design the UI of the website (Lead designer)
        </h3>
        <p>For this project, I went through several design iterations to find a simplistic yet unique design for our
            tool. To keep it simple I decided to have a simple login method that is unique to the university, by simply
            including course code. The design of the main chatroom initially an explorative approach to the look and
            feel. It worked as an intial prototype to gather feedback on the students and professors expectations. After
            we conducted the initial interviews, I realized that there was a lot of user expectation when creating an
            integrated tool. That is why I opted for a more Material design oriented look and feel that most are
            accostumed to.
            The tool would make use of vertical scrolling and better contrast, this did not only improve the feel but
            helped with understanding of the tool for new comers. Personally I aimed to a different and more distinct
            design from other tools, but I quickly learned the importance of tech literacy that users have, and how to
            take advantage of it.</p>
